# 250-project/Enigma code messaging service
## To Use
1. Use two like-systems (macOS to macOS using xcode, or linux-linux (have not tested many distros, but stuff like kali to mint works)
2. `g++ enigma.cpp -std=c++11`
3. `./a.out`

Both parties must have the same seed and rotor positions entered so that proper decoding will take place. The IP address must be known as well (use nslookup if you only have a domain name). Port must be agreed upon as well.
## Why
It sounded like a fun thing to do for a project, so I did it.
## How
Magic (see also: compile code inside code and call that code with command line parameters).
## What to do if you find a bug
Fix it if you want to, I may not get around to it because other obligations.

Email me: Kyle.korman@trojans.dsu.edu.

I promise there will be bugs, or you'll get your money back.
